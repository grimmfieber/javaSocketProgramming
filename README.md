# Basic game that guesses number sent by client.

## Just a basic implementation of socket

### What does it requires?
#### You only need to provide IP Address of Server and Port number.

>>How does it works?

Server side chooses a random number in range of 1-10 then client side tries guess the choosen number.
As client side guessed a number will send it to server. After then, server will check if number is true or not.
if it's not, server will sent a message to client as increase or decrease.
